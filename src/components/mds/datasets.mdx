## 🛰️ Dataset Overview
[**XA-L&RSI**] is a corss-modal dataset designed for research on LiDAR place recognition based on satellite imagery. The point cloud data was collected using Ouster OS1-64 LiDAR in Xiang'an District, Xiamen, with a trajectory mileage of approximately **100km**. The resolution of original satellite imagery is **0.5m**, processed into submaps of **60m x 60m**, with two-thirds overlap between adjacent submaps.

The remote sensing submaps are divided into a training set and several testing sets of different scales (**4km², 9km², 16km² and 100km²**), enabling evaluation under varying retrieval ranges.
For each submap, we provide the corresponding UTM coordinates.

The LiDAR point clouds are divided into training and testing subsets, as detailed in the accompanying **readme.txt** file. 
For each LiDAR frame, we provide the corresponding timestamp, UTM coordinates, and yaw angle, obtained from a high-precision RTK/INS system.
