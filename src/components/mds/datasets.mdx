<!--## 🛰️ Dataset Overview
[**LiRSI-XA**] is a corss-modal dataset designed for research on LiDAR place recognition based on satellite imagery. The point cloud data was collected using Ouster OS1-64 LiDAR in Xiang'an District, Xiamen, with a trajectory mileage of approximately **100km**. The resolution of original satellite imagery is **0.5m**, uniformly cropped into submaps of **60m x 60m**, with two-thirds overlap between adjacent submaps.

The remote sensing submaps are divided into a training set and several testing sets of different scales (**4km², 9km², 16km² and 100km²**), enabling evaluation under varying retrieval ranges.
For each submap, we provide the corresponding UTM coordinates.

The LiDAR point clouds are divided into training and testing subsets, as detailed in the accompanying **readme.txt** file. 
For each LiDAR frame, we provide the corresponding timestamp, UTM coordinates, and yaw angle, obtained from a high-precision RTK/INS system.

[**LiRSI-Oxford**] is an extension of the Oxford Radar RobotCar dataset. We supplement remote sensing images as a database (**2.8km²**). Provide only two sequences (11-14-02-26, 14-12-05-52) to verify the zero-shot generalization ability of the model. The preparation method of the data and the provided metadata are consistent with LiRSI-XA. 

[**LiRSI-Kitti360**] is an extension of the Kitti360 dataset, which is an urban scene dataset consisting of 9 sequences with a mileage of approximately **80km**, commonly used for 3D perception and localization. We associate each trajectory with corresponding remote sensing imagery. Contains six sequences for training (02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07), one sequence for validation (00), and two sequences for testing (09, 10). The preparation method of the data and the provided metadata are consistent with LiRSI-XA.
