# Method
To the best of our knowledge, The presented L2RSI is the first method for cross-view LiDAR-based place recognition within large-scale (over **100kmÂ²**) urban scenes using high-resolution remote sensing imagery. We unify LiDAR point cloud submaps and remote sensing submaps into a shared semantic space via a carefully-designed contrastive learning network. Furthermore, we propose the Spatial-Temproal Particle Estimation (**STPE**) to aggregate the spatio-temporal constraints of sequential queries, thereby further refining the performance of global place recognition.
